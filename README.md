DRT-301M-MODBusClient
=====================

modbusclient for the DRT-301M multi tarif energy meter from Forlong

http://www.cqbluejay.com/Support/Downloads/

The DRT-301M is a similar device to DRT-301C-II, DRS-202M, DRS-202C and DRT-301C.

They all are interfaced via RS-485 serial interface with MODBus RTU protocol.

The goal of this software is to have an easy possibility to interact with the meter, especially the energy and max demand counters.

The original documentation has some errors in the register definition. These have been annotated in the PDF.

modbusclient depends on libmodbus from libmodbus.org (libmodbus-3.0.6.tar.gz attached).
